# textscreen

This is a Python module to make it easier for you to show rich text (color, underscore, etc) in full screen mode on unix/linux x terminal. Please refer to [netstate.png] as an example to show a switch's realtime traffic status of its interfaces, where a colorful barchart was seamlessly shown in x ternminal.

It has logical window modules for you to create a or multiple logical window(s) on one x terminal and use every window to handle different purpose independently. 

It also has a textpad module for you manipulate the text content in a window. For example, you can easily move the text in a window.
